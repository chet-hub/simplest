# SSL introduction

## What is SSL? and TLS?
SSL is Secure Sockets Layer; TLS is Transport Layer Security. SSL and TLS are protocols for establishing authenticated and encrypted links between networked computers.(Russell, 2020)

## How can I tell that my web page is secure?
Generally, users can access web pages through insecure http or secure https protocols. For example, If Google Chrome’s address bar shows a lock, we can tell this web page is secure, because the web page is a https website.

Otherwise, if Chrome's address bar shows a warning triangle, the webpage is not secure, because the web page is a http website.

## What does it mean to be secure?
Being secure means users access an HTTPS website. HTTPS can guarantee the security of information, such as((Team, What is SSL? 2019)):
- Authenticity. The server provides the certificate (contains the identity of the server) for the user. Users can trust the sites are the sites they want to visite.
- Integrity. The web pages signed by the certificate are possible to change. users can trust the webpages are not changed in the way to the user.
- Encryption. Communications between the client and server are encrypted and the plaintext is hidden in the way.

## What is encryption and why do I care?
Plaintext translation between computers is not secure while encryption is an important way to protect the user’s plaintext.


## Do the prefixes HTTP or HTTPS matter when we're talking about secure web sites?
The prefixed HTTP or HTTPS matters becauses HTTPS is secure, while HTTP is not secure.

## What is an SSL certificate authority?
SSL certificate as an identity of an entity contains the digital information of the entity. The SSL certificate exists in the form of a public key and opened for the public. SSL certificate authority is a publicly trusted organization which signs certificates for other entities. These entities need the signed SSL certificate to prove they are secure for the public.

## What information do I need/want to be secured?
Personal information to be secured, such as
- Username and password for logging a website.
- Identification, credit, debit cards information, and Social Security Number
- Chat history, email, personal photos
