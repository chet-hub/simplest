# Minecraft Guide

## Introduction
In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally-generated 3D world with infinite terrain, and may discover and extract raw materials,  craft tools and items, and build structures or  earthworks . Depending on game mode, players can fight computer-controlled mobs as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. (Minecraft 2020)

## Two Game mode

 - Creative mode
Players have unlimited resources and they focus building the amazon world with the blocks. In this mode, the game actually is a world editor.

 - Survival mode
In a survival mode, players must build the world and keep live in the limited resource, as well as fighting with the monster. Most people play the game in this mode.

## Guide for new comers in survival mode

 1. Basic environmental tips
 When you enter a new world for the first time, it will be early morning. Just like reality, the sun in Minecraft rises in the east and sets in the west, while the clouds will always drift west. You can judge the time and direction by the position of the sun.
 
 3. Survival at night
The main threat comes from the wandering monsters at night. There are mainly zombies, skeletons, spiders, creepers, drowned and other naturally generated monsters with equipment. As a novice, don't try to fight monsters at the first night, because you lack a good weapon and a set of armor.

 3. Using a torch
Monsters cannot be spawned within 24 blocks of you, but it is no fun to stay in the shelter forever. When you leave home, you don't want to find that a monster has spawned or broke in when you come back. So you need to brighten your space. A torch can provide enough brightness to prevent monsters from spawning within a 7-block area centered on the torch.

4. Death
The character will die when the health value is reduced to 0. If you die in Minecraft, all the items on your body will be scattered around where you died, and you will respawn near the respawn point.
